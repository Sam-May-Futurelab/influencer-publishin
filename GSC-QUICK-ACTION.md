# Quick Action: Request Google Re-Indexing

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Request Indexing for Main URL
1. Go to: https://search.google.com/search-console
2. Click on **URL Inspection** (top search bar)
3. Enter: `https://inkfluenceai.com/`
4. Wait for inspection to complete
5. Click **Request Indexing** button
6. Wait for confirmation (may take 1-2 minutes)

### 2. Submit Updated Sitemap
1. In Google Search Console, go to **Sitemaps** (left sidebar)
2. Your sitemap should already be listed: `https://inkfluenceai.com/sitemap.xml`
3. If not, add it by entering `sitemap.xml` and clicking Submit
4. Check that status shows "Success"
5. Note the date it was submitted

### 3. Monitor Progress
Check these areas over the next 7 days:

**Page Indexing Report**
- Path: Indexing → Page indexing
- Watch for these numbers to decrease:
  - "Page with redirect" 
  - "Alternate page with proper canonical tag"
  - "Crawled - currently not indexed"
- Watch for "Indexed" count to increase

**URL Inspection**
- Check `https://inkfluenceai.com/` every 2-3 days
- Should eventually show: "URL is on Google"

### 4. Optional: Request Indexing for Key Pages
Repeat the URL Inspection process for these important pages:
- https://inkfluenceai.com/features
- https://inkfluenceai.com/pricing  
- https://inkfluenceai.com/blog

## Common Questions

**Q: Why 3 different issues for the same site?**
A: Google sees `http://`, `https://www.`, and `https://` as 3 different URLs. Now they all redirect to the canonical version.

**Q: When will indexing happen?**
A: Typically 3-7 days after requesting. Google crawls on their own schedule.

**Q: What if still not indexed after 2 weeks?**
A: Check for:
- Manual actions in GSC
- Coverage issues
- Page quality (thin content, mobile issues)
- Consider building more backlinks

**Q: Should I worry about the redirect warnings?**
A: No, redirects are normal and expected. Google just reports them for transparency.
