## 🎯 UX Issues & Recommendations

### **Issue 1: No Project Setup/Onboarding**
**Problem:** Users jump straight into writing without setting up basic project details (author, category, description, target audience).

**Impact:** 
- Missing metadata affects AI quality
- Poor SEO/export metadata
- No clear project identity

**Recommendation:**
✅ **Add Project Setup Dialog** after title entry:
```
Step 1: Project Details
- Title ✓ (already entered)
- Author name
- Category (dropdown: Business, Fiction, Non-Fiction, etc.)
- Target Audience (who is this for?)
- Short description

[Skip for Now] [Continue]
```

---

### **Issue 2: Empty Chapter Editor is Intimidating**
**Problem:** After creating a project, users face a blank editor with no guidance.

**Impact:**
- Analysis paralysis
- High abandonment rate
- Users don't know where to start

**Recommendation:**
✅ **Add Welcome Card** to first chapter:
```
📝 Welcome to Your New Project!

Quick Actions:
[🤖 Generate Chapter Outline] [✍️ Start Writing] [💡 Get AI Suggestions]

Tips:
• Use AI Assistant (right panel) for content ideas
• Press Ctrl+Space for quick AI help
• Save snippets of great content for reuse
```

---

### **Issue 3: AI Assistant is Hidden**
**Problem:** The AI Assistant panel is on the right but users may not notice it.

**Impact:**
- Underutilization of key feature
- Users write from scratch when AI could help

**Recommendation:**
✅ **First-Time Tooltip** on AI panel:
```
[Animated arrow pointing right]
"Need help writing? Try the AI Assistant! →"
[Got it]
```

---

### **Issue 4: No Clear "What's Next?" After Writing**
**Problem:** After writing chapters, users don't know the next steps (branding, cover, export).

**Impact:**
- Incomplete ebooks
- Users don't explore features
- Low export rate

**Recommendation:**
✅ **Progress Checklist** in Dashboard:
```
Your Progress: 3/5 Steps Complete

✅ Create project
✅ Write chapters (2 chapters)
⬜ Customize branding
⬜ Design cover
⬜ Export & publish

[Next: Customize Branding →]
```

---

### **Issue 5: Branding/Cover Design Separated from Flow**
**Problem:** Users have to manually navigate to Settings/Profile to access brand customizer and cover designer.

**Impact:**
- Features are hidden
- Ebooks lack professional polish
- Low feature discovery

**Recommendation:**
✅ **Add "Customize" Tab** in Chapter Editor:
```
Tabs: [✍️ Write] [🎨 Customize] [📤 Export]

Customize Tab:
- Brand Colors & Fonts
- Cover Design
- Style Preview
```

---

### **Issue 6: Multiple Import Clicks**
**Problem:** Import requires 2 clicks: "Import File" card → "Import Document" button.

**Impact:**
- Unnecessary friction
- Confused users

**Recommendation:**
✅ **Direct Import on Card Click**
- Make "Import File" card directly open the import dialog
- Remove redundant "Import Document" button

---

### **Issue 7: No Preview Before Commit**
**Problem:** Users can't preview template content before creating from it.

**Current:** Eye icon shows preview ✓
**Issue:** Preview doesn't show chapter breakdown

**Recommendation:**
✅ **Enhanced Template Preview:**
```
Preview Dialog:
- Chapter list with titles
- Word count estimate
- Sample content snippet
- [Use This Template] button
```

---

### **Issue 8: Export Flow is Hidden**
**Problem:** Export options are in top menu but not obvious.

**Impact:**
- Users write but don't export
- Unclear how to get final product

**Recommendation:**
✅ **Export Dashboard Widget:**
```
Ready to Publish?
Your ebook has 2 chapters, 1,234 words

[📄 Export as PDF] [📱 Export as EPUB] [📝 Export as DOCX]
```

---

### **Issue 9: Drag-and-Drop Not Obvious**
**Problem:** Users don't know they can drag files to import.

**Recommendation:**
✅ **Visual Cue on Dashboard:**
```
[Dotted border animation when no projects]
"Drag & drop a .docx file here to import"
```

---

### **Issue 10: No Quick Templates**
**Problem:** Template gallery has 20+ templates but no "Quick Start" option.

**Recommendation:**
✅ **Quick Templates on Dashboard:**
```
Quick Start:
[5-Chapter Business Book] [10-Chapter How-To Guide] [Blank Project]
```
