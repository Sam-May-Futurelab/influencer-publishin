# Future Features & Enhancements

## ðŸš€ IN DEVELOPMENT

### Phase 1: Free Preview Generator (1-2 days)
**Status:** Planning â†’ Implementation

**Decision Made:**
- Keep existing landing page (`/`)
- Create new dedicated page `/preview` or `/try-free`
- Add prominent CTA on landing page â†’ "/try-free"
- Better for SEO (separate pages targeting different keywords)

**SEO Benefits:**
- Landing `/` = "ebook creator", "AI writing tool" (broad)
- Preview `/try-free` = "free ebook generator", "try AI writing free" (conversion)
- More pages = more ranking opportunities
- Different meta descriptions & keywords per page

**Implementation:**
- âœ… New route: `/try-free`
- âœ… New component: `src/components/TryFreePage.tsx`
- âœ… New API: `api/preview-chapter.js` (no auth, IP rate-limited)
- âœ… Update landing page with CTA button
- âœ… Rate limiting: 1 generation per IP per day (Vercel Edge Config or simple timestamp check)
- âœ… Generate 1 chapter only (500-750 words)
- âœ… Show result with watermark + signup CTA
- âœ… No database saves (ephemeral only)

**Technical Notes:**
- Use `req.headers['x-forwarded-for']` or `req.socket.remoteAddress` for IP
- Cache in memory or use Vercel KV for rate limit tracking
- Clear separation from main app (no project creation)

**Why These Features Matter:**
1. Free Preview = Removes barrier to entry, shows quality
2. Full AI Gen = Competitive parity with ebookmaker.ai
3. Audiobooks = Premium differentiation, high perceived value
