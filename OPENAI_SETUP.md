## Why This Changed

Previously, the OpenAI API key was stored in the browser (insecure). Now it's stored securely on Vercel's servers.

## Current Setup (Recommended)

Follow the guide in `VERCEL_API_SETUP.md` which covers:
1. Deploying to Vercel (FREE)
2. Securely storing your API key
3. Testing the integration

<summary>Old Setup Method (Not Recommended - API Key Exposed)</summary>

## Step 1: Get Your OpenAI API Key

1. Go to [OpenAI API Keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Click "Create new secret key"
3. Give it a name (e.g., "Influencer Publishing App")
4. Copy the API key (starts with `sk-proj-...`)

## Step 2: Add API Key to Environment

1. Open the `.env` file in the project root
2. Replace `your_new_api_key_here` with your actual API key:
   ```
   VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-your-actual-key-here
   ```
3. Save the file

## Step 3: Restart the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Warning

This method exposes your API key in the browser and is **NOT RECOMMENDED** for production.
